# Unzip/Zip Python
________________________
It is a automation script written in python at allows user to manipulate (create, read, and update) archive files from the command-line interface. Since, windows doesnot have any built-in functionality similar to unzip in linux so this script is written with that in mind and it is also platform independent (except .exe file)
